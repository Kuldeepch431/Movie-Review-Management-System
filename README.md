# Project Explanation:
The Movie Review Management System is a Spring Boot application designed to manage movies and their reviews. This system allows administrators to add new movies and users to find movies based on title or genre. Additionally, users can add reviews and ratings for movies, which are then aggregated to provide an average rating for each movie.
